# Overview:

This document provides an overview of the project, including its purpose, features, and technology stack

# Purpose:

The project is an academic endeavor aimed at implementing authentication tasks with a profile page for the ASCI module. It serves as a learning exercise to understand and implement various authentication mechanisms and security practices.

# Features:

**Hashing Password:** Passwords are securely hashed before storage to enhance security.

- **JWT-Based Authentication:** Authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless communication between client and server.
- **Spring Security:** The project leverages Spring Security for implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Authorization Handling:** Authorization is managed effectively using Spring Security to control access to different resources.
- **Frontend Input Validation:** User input is validated on the frontend to ensure data integrity and security.
- **Backend API Validation:** API inputs are validated on the backend to prevent malicious or invalid data from entering the system.
- **Sign In and Sign Up Pages:** Dedicated pages are provided for user registration and authentication.
